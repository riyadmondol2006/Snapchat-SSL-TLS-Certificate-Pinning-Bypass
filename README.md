   - Start capturing decrypted Snapchat HTTPS traffic

### Method 2: Using Frida CLI (Advanced Users)

**Requires Root Access | Manual Frida Setup | Full Control**

1. **Install Original Snapchat APK**
   ```bash
   # Install standard Snapchat from Play Store or APK
   adb install com.snapchat.android.apk
   ```

2. **Execute Frida SSL Bypass Script**
